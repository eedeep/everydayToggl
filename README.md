# everydayToggl
Do your toggl without touching the web interface, everyday, like a good boy.

## Input file format
If the contents of your "timesheet files" look like this, everydayToggl
laps them up and deposits them in toggl and all you ever had to do was use vim
or sublime or whatever it is you use to code with (which you were already using anyways, get it?):

```
s:1010 e:1025 doing the standup
s:1026 e:1100 reviewing ricky's code and talking to greg about a plan for taking the next step
s:1101 e:1140 talking to nick and jay about how to debug/diagnose
s:1140 e:1400 all hands meeting then team lunch
s:1401 e:1606 talking to jay about debugging direction and then talking to greg about the history of docker stuff, where ricky got to and how to proceed
```
